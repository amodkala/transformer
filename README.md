# transformer

PyTorch implementation of the vanilla decoder-only transformer architecture for text classification.

This code is adapted from my final project for ECON 424 at UW, in which students were tasked with creating a text classification model with grades based on the model's accuracy. The course material covered machine learning algorithms from linear regression to recurrent and convolutional neural networks (RNNs and CNNs), but I set myself the challenge of implementing a slightly modified version of the transformer neural network from Vaswani et al. (2017). I spent many hours learning how to implement the model and I had a ton of fun, though in hindisght I likely would have been better off using a pretrained model instead.
